*Need to find a type library (.tlb file) or dll that contains the IServiceProvider com interface. It doesn't seem to come with Windows by default. IServiceProvider is needed for mozilla and Internet Explorer to retrieve their respective HTML interfaces.
*Need to write an NVDAObject for the _WwG MS Word control. In MS Word itself, Word.Application can be used, but for the MS Word viewer, Word.Application may not actually exist.

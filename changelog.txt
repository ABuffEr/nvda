Changes since revision 164:
*Fixed some bugs in the sapi5 driver, making it more responsive, and less likely to not stop speaking when asked to.
*Objects that do not have a specific type (client objects) are now reported as "window".
*The PC speaker is now used to communicate the percentage of a progress bar as it goes up (example: copying a large amount of data in windows explorer, or loading a large web page in internet explorer).
*group box names are now reported when an object with the focus is in one. (Example: settings buttons, advanced tab, system properties dialog, control panel). 
*NVDA can now read formatting changes in documents whilst reading with say all.
*If your synthesizer is set to "auto" in nvda.ini (which it now is by default), NVDA will search for the first available synthesizer. Currently it looks for sapi5 and then sapi4 and then Viavoice. the more likely found synthesizers are first.
*Fixed some crashes in MS Office applications
*If an object supports it, you can now review it with the numpad by line, word or character when you navigate to it with the insert numpad commands. Previously you could only review the object with focus.
*Static text objects are now reviewable. This means it is now possible to review dialog text such as in the NBDA About dialog box. Just Navigate to the static text with the insert numpad commands and use the numpad keys to read it. 
*When moving focus to a list, the active list item now always gets spoken. (If there is no active list item, then it will say at least how many items are in the list, most of the time this is 0). Previously some lists spoke the active item, some didn't. 
*You can now move the mouse pointer to the current navigator object position with insert+numpadDivide. Also you can move the current Navigator object to the mouse pointer with insert+numpadMultiply.
*Fixed a bug that stopped internet explorer reading when pressing tab
*Links no longer say the URL as their value. They also now say "visited link" for visited links.
*Greatly improved the internet explorer virtualBuffer by having the type of object (link, heading, list) spoken as you arrow on to it, but not having it actually written physically in the buffer. So if you arrow to a link, you can straight away arrow through its name, rather than arrowing across l i n k first. 
*Frames are now supported in Internet Explorer.
*Edit fields in Internet Explorer forms are now able to be navigated with the cursor.
*It is now possible to edit and navigate in editable internet explorer windows (example: Outlook Express new message window). A part from a few controls which may not properly report their names, this makes Outlook Express now usable for both reading and writing messages.
*Fixed bug where the default configuration had alignment=Always in the documentFormatting section. It is now Never. Please edit your nvda.ini to reflect this change if in deed your file was generated when this bug existed).
*Made MS Word and MS Excel slightly more responsive by using pre-generated com interface python code rather than querying the com interfaces each time a property or method is accessed. 
*Made NVDA over all much more responsive (especially in edit fields such as an address bar)
*Fixed bug where tooltips and help balloons were not speaking
*Fixed up some bugs in mouse tracking (NVDA should now report objects as the mouse moves over them).
*Added key echo scripts:
-insert+2 toggle speak typed characters
-insert+3 toggle speak typed words
-insert+4 toggle speak command keys
These scripts also make sure they say * when typing in edit fields with the protected state set (e.g. password fields).
*Fixed handling of crashes so that if the screen reader core dies, it should take the GUI down with it
*Added a voice dialog on the preferences menu
*The synthesizer dialog now only shows synthesizers currently found on your system. It also now has a longer description for each synth (including the name of the dll or com interface it uses)
*Added a save configuration to the NVDA menu. This writes the current config to nvda.ini, previously this was done automatically on exit. However, nvda.in is written to disc also once NVDA has been started successfully.
*Insert+q now properly activates the exit message dialog box, saying yes will exit NVDA completely.
*NVDA now starts with its window completely hidden (not even just minimized). You now need to press insert+n to bring it up, and press alt+f4 to make it go away. 
*The NVDA window when shown should be now centered in the middle of the screen and is 300 by 300 pixels in size. 
*Improved the internal structure of NVDA objects and virtualBuffers and made NVDA less dependent on MSAA. (NVDA still needs MSAA for most things, but now it is much easier for support for other accessibility APIs to be designed).
*Removed the IBM Viavoice synth driver due to licencing restrictions 

Changes since revision 82:
*Added support for the automatic speaking of font, style, page number etc of documents.
*Fixed many small bugs to do with navigating documents by character, word and line.
*Added support for Microsoft Word:
-Navigating by character, word and line
-Finding out current font, page number, style, whether you are in a table
*Added support for Microsoft Excel:
-Navigating around cells
-Finding out current font, coordinates, whether it has a formular
*Much improved support for dos console windows:
-Fixed bug that would crash NVDA when dos console windows close
-More responsive reading of new text (now watches for MSAA console events rather than checking over and over until it changes)
-No longer speaks new text if the new text is a character that the user has just typed
*Re-written virtualBuffer support:
-Now you can use the normal arrow keys to navigate like an edit field
-insert+space changes to focusInteractionMode so that key presses such as the arrows go straight through to the object with focus. (Used with Internet Explore to interact with certain form fields).
*Support for Internet Explorer document windows:
-Works both in and out of Internet Explorer itself (example: html messages in outlook express)
-Gives you the ability to navigate the document with the arrows (character, word and line)
-Detects links, form fields, headings etc.
*A new synth driver for IBM Viavoice has been added as "viavoice" (Works with versions that hav ibmeci50.dll).
*Improved sapi5 synth driver to include changing the voice
*When reading by character, pitch of speech goes up to denote capital letters if the synth supports it
*Improved overall responsivness by implementing MSAA support directly in to NVDA rather than using the pyAA (python Active Accessibility) library
*Added a keyboard help mode (insert+1)
*Included some minimal documentation in to the stand alone version of NVDA when it is built
*Added the ability for appModules to register and unregister their own NVDA objects and virtual Buffer objects
*Synth drivers now are stored in the synthDrivers directory, rather than in the base directory
*Added a toggle speech script (insert+s) to temporarily turn off speech
*Improved text processing before sending it to the synth so that words that have entirely capitalized sections such as in "NVDAObjects" are read correctly. Also so it handles the reading of words ending in numbers properly.
*Added support for reading plaine/rich text messages in outlook Express. (Together with the internet explorer support for HTML messages, this means all messages should be able to be read).
 *NVDA now by default asks the operating system for the names of control roles and states, but the defaults can be replaced in the NVDA dictionaries
*A say all script has been added for edit fields and documents (insert+downArrow)
*Increase and decrease rate scripts (insert+pageUp and insert+pageDown) have been added.
*The GUI has been changed so that there is an NVDA window. If closed, NVDA will exit. It also has a menu bar with menus to control NVDA:
-NVDA menu, exit
-Preferences menu, synthesizer...
-Help menu, about...
